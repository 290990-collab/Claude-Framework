# Research principles

For projects whose product is not "software that runs" but **reproducible
evidence**. Permanent guidelines on *how one reasons*, not on which skills to
have.

> **Guiding principle.** Every decision is motivated by data, experiments or
> literature; every result is explainable, reproducible and verifiable by
> others.

## Evidence and honesty

1. **Evidence first** — every technical statement rests on a measurement, a
   source or an experiment. Never on a plausible supposition.
2. **Facts, interpretations and ideas stay separate**, typographically too.
   Confusing the three is the most common way of writing something false
   without lying.
3. **Explicit assumptions** about problem, data and model: the unspoken ones
   are the ones that turn out to be wrong.
4. **Negative results are reported.** A refuted hypothesis is acquired
   information: hiding it means paying its cost again later.
5. **Scepticism towards your own improvements**: a gain is a hypothesis to
   verify, not an acquired result.
6. **Strengths and weaknesses are both reported.** Work that exposes only its
   strong points cannot be assessed.

## Experimental method

7. **Baseline before complexity.** First the simple reference — even trivial,
   even random — then the elaborate architecture. Without the right
   denominator, a gain can be overestimated by an order of magnitude.
8. **One variable at a time.** If you change two things together, the effect is
   not attributable and the experiment is wasted.
9. **Every added component must be justified by an ablation**: if removing it
   changes nothing, it was not needed.
10. **The success criterion is decided before** looking at the results.
    Deciding it afterwards is choosing the conclusion.
11. **Measurement against intuition**: the metrics decide, not the feeling that
    something "should" work better.
12. **Fair comparisons**: same data, same protocol, same exclusions, model
    capacity declared when it differs.
13. **Respect significance**: differences of the order of the noise are not
    results until the contrary is shown.
14. **Error analysis before improvement**: understanding *how* it fails
    precedes the attempt to make it fail less.
15. **Understand before optimising.**

## Data integrity

16. **The test set selects nothing.** Hyperparameters, variants and checkpoints
    are chosen on the validation set; the test set is touched once, for the
    final number.
17. **Normalisation statistics from the training set alone.**
18. **Beware circularity**: if the model receives as input what the ground
    truth measures as output, on that dimension the result is an upper bound,
    not a performance. It must be declared every time.
19. **Do not optimise for a single benchmark**: what comes out of it measures
    the benchmark, not the problem.

## Reproducibility

20. **Seeds and sources of randomness fixed and declared.**
21. **Configuration outside the code**, versioned together with the result it
    produced.
22. **Every reported number must be traceable**: which configuration, which
    run, which file. A number without provenance is not citable.
23. **Do not relaunch an experiment** to get back a number that already exists
    in a log or a summary.

## In this project

[TO FILL IN — the current research hypothesis, which sets exist and which
selects what, the metrics adopted and what they can hide, the baselines
available, the known circularities, who launches the heavy runs and how, where
the results are written.]
