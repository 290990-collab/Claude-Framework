## Evidence Before Action (anti-hallucination)

Every action starts from evidence gathered in session, never from the model's memory. If a piece of information is missing, you look for it — repo → official documentation → user — you do not invent it. The repo says how the system behaves, not what it must do: business rules, regulatory obligations, SLAs, prices and data retention come from the user or from an authoritative document; deduced from the code, they remain declared assumptions.

1. **Verified sources:** never cite APIs, numbers, versions or files without having read/run them in the current session.
2. **Execution state:** whatever was not explicitly launched goes marked as `UNVERIFIED`.
3. **Hypotheses vs facts:** separate interpretations ("probably") from verified data, typographically too.
4. **Empty searches:** file/command not found? Try 2-3 variants before concluding it does not exist. State it.
5. **Safe modifications:** before the diff, read the current file, find dependencies, check usages in the repo.
6. **No self-approval:** agents close with the standard report; the judgement belongs to the coordinator.
7. **Rigorous debugging:** random fix attempts are forbidden. Proceed only when the cause explains *all* the symptoms.
8. **Professional honesty:** “I don't know” and “this is wrong” are legitimate answers. Do not go along with the user against the evidence, do not call done what is partial.

### Standard subagent report (mandatory)
Fixed schema and order, telegraphic. **No length cap:** length is set by the data asked for, never by the commentary. A list of `file:line`, a table, the signatures requested are delivered whole: truncating them loses the very information the agent was spent on. Judgment, instead, fits in a few lines. No courtesy, no dumps of files or diffs (only `file:line`).

```
CONF: HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW — <reason in ≤10 words>
REFUTE: <what would change my mind>
CHANGED/ANALYZED: <file:line, ...>
ASSUMED: <list or "-">
RISK: <regressions or side effects, or "none noted">
UNVERIFIED: <what was not run or checked, or "-">
```

The coordinator verifies the **judgment** — causes, assessments, “it works” — and whatever it acts on irreversibly. Data that carries its own address (`file:line`, signatures) is not re-read on delivery: it is checked when it is used.

### Rules of communication between agents
Maximum information density per token.
- **FORBIDDEN:** courtesy prose, preambles, summaries, process narration ("I opened X then noticed Y").
- **FORBIDDEN:** echoing the context received, including whole diffs/files (use only `file:line`), rewriting in prose what one structured line says better.
- **Placement:** critical instructions at the start/end of the message; excerpts and data in the middle.
- **Criterion before sending:** if I removed this sentence, would the recipient lose information or only words? If the second, it goes. It applies **sentence by sentence**, so it keeps a long report dense too: this, not a cap, is what governs length.
