"""Reading the transcripts of `claude -p --output-format stream-json --verbose`.

One JSON line per event. `framework-comply` takes the tool calls from them, in
order, to label which steps of a rule were executed. The format belongs to the
harness and changes with it: the test fixture is a real transcript, and an
event without the expected shape is an error, not a skip — a step skipped in
silence would read as a rule not followed.
