"""The lifecycle of an installation: what gets written, what gets removed, what gets repaired.

Every mode that writes goes through a plan: one operation per file, computed
without touching anything, which the user reads before saying yes. Execution
receives the approved plan and does not compute another: it re-checks that the
tree is still the one the plan was made on, and if it is not it refuses before
writing the first byte. A plan approved on a tree that has changed in the
meantime is an approval given to something else.

The ownership rules are three. A file is deleted only if it is byte-for-byte
identical to the source, that is if it holds nobody's work. What the project
adapted — cards, guides, styles — is archived whole, never deleted. From
`settings.json` only what `settings_added` says the framework added is removed,
plus the hook entries that would point to a script that is gone.
