```

**A working method for Claude Code, installed in one command and kept honest by a doctor.**

Specialised subagents, delegation rules, evidence-before-action and a context
budget per role — generated into your project, versioned, and checked by a tool
that tells you the moment an installation drifts.

---

## Why

Claude Code gives you subagents, hooks and skills. It does not give you a
**method** — so everyone writes one by hand, per project, and watches it drift.

- **Agents that stay in their lane.** A roster picked for your project, a routing
  table, one task per agent with a verifiable done-criterion, and one fixed report
  every subagent closes with: confidence, what would disprove it, what it did
  **not** verify.
- **Context you actually use.** The method every agent needs lives in
  `CLAUDE.md`; delegation lives where only the coordinator reads it; guides load
  on demand. `fwbuild cost` turns the words into tokens and dollars.
- **Guardrails that don't trust the model.** Hooks block `--no-verify` and edits
  that loosen an existing linter config. Read-only reviewers get no shell at all.
- **One method, every project.** The generated method sits in a hashed kernel
  region: edit it and the doctor sees it, and `framework-sync` carries the edits
  worth keeping back into the source.

## Install

Once per machine. Needs Claude Code and Python 3.11+ — nothing else to install.

### macOS · Linux

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/290990-collab/CLAW.git ~/.claude/CLAW
   ```

2. Copy one edition as your source — `CLAW-eng`, or `CLAW-it` for Italian

   ```bash
   cp -r ~/.claude/CLAW/CLAW-eng ~/.claude/framework
   ```

3. Create the personal skills folder

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
   ```

4. Add `/framework-install` — generates the method into a project

   ```bash
   cp -r ~/.claude/framework/skills/framework-install ~/.claude/skills/
   ```

5. Add `/framework-comply` — measures whether a rule is followed

   ```bash
   cp -r ~/.claude/framework/skills/framework-comply ~/.claude/skills/
   ```

### Windows · PowerShell

1. Clone the repository

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/290990-collab/CLAW.git $HOME\.claude\CLAW
   ```

2. Copy one edition as your source — `CLAW-eng`, or `CLAW-it` for Italian

   ```powershell
   Copy-Item -Recurse $HOME\.claude\CLAW\CLAW-eng $HOME\.claude\framework
   ```

3. Create the personal skills folder

   ```powershell
   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force $HOME\.claude\skills | Out-Null
   ```

4. Add `/framework-install` — generates the method into a project

   ```powershell
   Copy-Item -Recurse $HOME\.claude\framework\skills\framework-install $HOME\.claude\skills\framework-install
   ```

5. Add `/framework-comply` — measures whether a rule is followed

   ```powershell
   Copy-Item -Recurse $HOME\.claude\framework\skills\framework-comply $HOME\.claude\skills\framework-comply
   ```

### Then, in any project

```
/framework-install
```

## Use

### In Claude Code

| Command | When | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/framework-install` | once per project | Reads the repo, asks a short questionnaire, picks the roster, generates everything, verifies it |
| `/framework-doctor` | something looks off, before an update | Checks the installation; every finding comes with its remedy |
| `/framework-memory` | long session, after a restructure | Pairs every stale memory with the repo line that contradicts it |
| `/framework-comply <rule>` | a rule seems ignored | Counts how often each step of the rule is followed across `claude -p` runs — 17 by default, on your tokens |

### Keeping in sync — `/framework-sync <mode>`

| Mode | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--down` | New source version into the project, your adaptation kept |
| `--up [what]` | A local change up into the source, so the next project inherits it |
| `--upgrade` | A new release over a source you changed with `--up` |
| `--activate <agent\|guide>` | Adds an agent or a guide at the source's current version |
| `--deactivate <agent\|guide>` | Removes it from the project; the source keeps it |
| `--repair` | Puts back missing skills, hooks, guides and state files; overwrites nothing |
| `--uninstall` | Deletes what matches the source, archives what you adapted |

Every mode that writes shows the plan first and waits for your ok.

### From the shell — in `<source>/tools`

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `python -m fwbuild doctor --strict <project>` | The doctor's check; exit 1 on warnings too |
| `python -m fwbuild doctor --json <project>` | Findings plus the `CLAUDE.md` measure, for CI |
| `python -m fwbuild cost <project> [--spawns N] [--devs N] [--price USD]` | Estimated cost of `CLAUDE.md`: its tokens × spawns a day × people × price per million input tokens. Defaults: 100 spawns, 1 person, $5 |
| `python -m fwbuild report <folder>` | Which method versions run where, across repos; `--depth`, `--strict`, `--json` |
| `python -m fwbuild source [path]` | Validates a source and says whether it was promoted with `--up` |

### Settings

| Setting | Effect |
|---|---|
| `$CLAUDE_FRAMEWORK` | Source location, checked after `./framework/` and before `~/.claude/framework/` |
| `FRAMEWORK_GATEGUARD=off` | Turns the `gateguard` hook off |
| `accepted` in `.claude/framework.json` | Warnings you accept: printed as notes, `--strict` still passes |

**Profiles:** `software` · `library` · `web` · `data` · `research` · `llm` ·
`marketing` — each sets the roster, the guides and the permissions for its
field.

The framework writes `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/` and `docs/`, and nothing else. Your
code, build and dependencies stay untouched.
