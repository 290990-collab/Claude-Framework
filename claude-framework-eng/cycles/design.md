## The design cycle

It slots into the code cycle between *Understand* and *Design*. Here visual rendering is part of the product: an interface that is correct and ugly is not a partial success, it is a product that contradicts itself.

**Understand → Direction → Design → Implement → Verify (functional *and* visual) → Integrate.**

The added step is the second:

**Direction** (`frontend`, before any markup): grid, type scale, palette, rhythm of space, tone of motion. Decided **before** the first component and expressed in tokens, not in adjectives. Ambiguous requests → plan mode or brainstorming first.

Rules of the cycle:

- **Never jump to markup before the direction:** a component written without a system becomes the system, by inertia.
- **Visual verification is neither optional nor automatic:** a green build and green tests do not prove it looks right. You look at runtime; what was not looked at goes back into `UNVERIFIED` with the instructions for looking at it. An interface task closed without that line is not closed.
- **The unit test covers pure logic**, not rendering: tests on markup give false confidence and break at every touch-up.
- **Accessibility and performance are requirements of the cycle**, not a final review: they enter the direction.
