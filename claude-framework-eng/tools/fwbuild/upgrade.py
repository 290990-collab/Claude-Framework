"""Bringing a new release over a source the user has modified.

`--up` exists because the source gets modified: whoever does it, though, faced
a flat choice at the next release — overwrite and lose their own work, or stay
behind forever. Only one datum is missing to avoid it: **which release that copy
came from**. The number in `VERSION` is not enough, because `--up` increments it
and from then on it matches nothing published.

The comparison is over three trees and the classification has four outcomes, no
more: they are the only possible combinations, and they treat a deletion as any
other change (an absent file is a content like the others).
