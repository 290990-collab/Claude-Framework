"""The integrity checks of an installation.

Eighteen finding codes: eight of severity ERROR (PLACEHOLDER, ROSTER_MISSING,

COORDINATOR_LEAK, SKILLS_MISSING, VERSION_MISMATCH, SETTINGS_MISSING,

Every code is explained, with what to do about it, in the `framework-doctor`

declared it accepts in `framework.json`. It stays printed — an invisible waiver
