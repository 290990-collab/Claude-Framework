**Why:** it is the regression that makes `logtail -f` unusable in production,
and it blocks any work on incremental filters.
**Done when:** `tests/test_follow.py` covers rotation, truncation and
recreation of the file, and passes on `fixtures/big.log` at constant memory.
**Depends on:** —
**Risks:** rotation behaviour depends on the filesystem — it must be tried on a
network volume too.

"""

PROJECT_SECTIONS = """## The project

`logtail` — a command-line tool that follows and filters log files in real
time.

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/logtail/core/` | pure logic: incremental reading, parsing, filters |
| `src/logtail/cli/` | argument parsing, terminal rendering |
| `tests/` | tests for every module of `core/` |
| `fixtures/` | real, dirty logs for the tests |

**HARD constraints:**

- `core/` does not import from `cli/`: the dependency goes one way only.
- Constant memory during follow, whatever the size of the file.
- Malformed lines do not stop processing and end up in a count.

**Contracts:** the format of `~/.logtail.toml` · the names of the subcommands
and options · the exit codes. Changing them breaks users' scripts.

## Commands

```bash
python -m pytest -q          # tests — the quick check the agent runs
ruff check && ruff format    # analysis and formatting
python -m build              # full build
```

The performance measurements on `fixtures/big.log` (2 GB) are launched by the
user.

## Critical surface

Security: the user's filter patterns become regular expressions, the paths come
from the command line and from configuration, and the logs can contain
credentials. `security-reviewer` reviews before the final check.

## Current state

Project just initialised. No consolidated conclusions.

## Shared guides

**Coordinator only, and first if the session delegates:**
`.claude/shared/orchestration.md` — when to delegate and to whom, the work
cycle, how to write a prompt, how state is kept up to date.

To be opened when the task falls in their domain:
`.claude/shared/core/conventions.md` ·
`.claude/shared/core/coding-standards.md` ·
`.claude/shared/core/architecture-guide.md` ·
`.claude/shared/core/testing-guide.md` ·
`.claude/shared/core/debugging-playbook.md` ·
`.claude/shared/core/review-checklist.md`

## Reply style

Concise but complete, with the reason for non-obvious choices. Python, tests
and the command line are taken as known; everything concerning the behaviour of
file descriptors and encodings is introduced at first mention.
